description: "Last week's press reported on the deaths of two teenagers from the Southwest. It made very difficult reading. The secondary school years can be a time when our young people are at their most vulnerable. How do we support them to develop a strong sense of self-worth, and encourage them to behave with respect and positivity towards their peers?"
